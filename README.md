#### Java GUI for Neural Networks to classify digits

The system allows you to construct a neural network (with its graphical interpretation), load some data to train the network and monitor training results.

After the network has been trained, you can test it on sample images, and save for future loads.

The system is designed to work with digit classification tasks.

Some examples of its GUI:
